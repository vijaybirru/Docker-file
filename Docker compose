Docker compose
While working with docker based microservices its very difficult to manually setup hundreds of microservice, 
so docker compose is a tool using which we can describe about microservices 
in YAML file and quickly setup complete environment with a single command

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, 
you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and 
start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the list of features.

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows.
You can learn more about each case in Common Use Cases.
